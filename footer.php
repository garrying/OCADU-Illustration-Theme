		<blockquote>Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br />
		Of night and light and the half light,
		I would spread the cloths under your feet:
		But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br />
		I have spread my dreams under your feet;
		Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</blockquote>
